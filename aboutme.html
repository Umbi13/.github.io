            he looks at the world and current affairs with great curiosity.
            He has done many jobs, so different from one another, that allowed him
            to accumulate a good level of experience which he hopes to make in
            to work in the next years. </p>

        <p>He likes to work by himself (who doesn't?), but knowing he can do his best
          in a team, where ideas and opinions are exchanged.

          a flexible mindset: expect the unexpected.</p>

          to be able to tell them.</p>
